##Implementation:

To calculate the Loan repayment is been used the formula: 

 A= P * ( r(1+r)^n / (1+r)^n âˆ’1 )
 
 where:
 
 - P is the principal amount borrowed
 - A is the periodic amortization payment
 - r is the periodic interest rate divided by 100
 - n is the total number of payments
 
 
 To calculate the loan rate:
 
 - The lenders CSV has been filtered to get the lowest rate
 - This interest rate has been decreased by 0.11, having Zopa the best interest rate in front of the Lenders
 - All rate have been rounded to the upper closet value, from 6.79% to 7% 
 - The repayments have been rounded to the closest value with 2 digits
